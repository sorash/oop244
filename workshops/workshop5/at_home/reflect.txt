1) first it checks if the phone number is valid by calling the isValid function. then if the number has been validated, it sets the variable values for area and number from the given ones. then it makes sure there are no previously left over data in the memory of type_. it then dynamically allocates memory for type_ with the length of given value + 1 for null character, and then copies the value into it. it then returns the validity of the number.
2) because dynamic memory allocates as much memory as needed and may be different each time. Therefore the programmer needs custom copy and assignment overloads to copy every element in the dynamically allocated memory.
